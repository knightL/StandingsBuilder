README for StandingsBuilder v1.2
===========

This is program for building standings for ACM contests from different sources like other standings or logs of contests. The result of work is HTML file with merged standings

The program requires libxml2 in order to work properly. Also it is recommended to have libcurl installed, so program will be able to download files from internet. If you don't want this, you can run configuration script as follows:

	./configure --without-libcurl

 In case you use Ubuntu to install libxml2 you should install package with name libxml2-dev. To install libcurl, you may install either of 3 packages: libcurl4-openssl-dev, libcurl4-gnutls-dev or libcurl4-nss-dev.

Program requires XML config of the following form (case sensitive):

    <Builder>
      <ProblemCount>11</ProblemCount>
      <RefreshRate>300</RefrestRate>
      <OutputFile>output.html</OutputFile>
      <Parsers>
        ...List of parsers to use...
      </Parsers>
    </Builder>

ProblemCount is number of problems in current contest
RefreshRate is delay in seconds, after which output file will be rewritten
OutputFile is path to file, where the result of program will be written

Parsers should contain list of parsers (programs, that fetch information and
place it into log). Currently supported parsers:

 > EjudgeParser
     _Provides time_
     Necessary attribute: [Path] or [URL]
     Optional attribute: [Timeless]=No/Yes
     Downloads Ejudge standings either on local computer from[Path] or by link [URL], parses it and puts teams in it into resulting standing. If [Timeless] is true, the parser will not attempt to get and store time of submissions

 > NEERCXmlParser
     Necessary attribute: [Path] or [URL]
     Parses NEERC contests history pack and unrolles by simulating attempts from it.

 > NEERCHtmlParser
     Necessary attribute: [Path]
     Optional attribute: [HideUnsolved]=No/Yes
     Reads final standings of NEERC contest in HTML format and attempts to simulate it. It is unknown, when were wrong attempts made, so for problems that were accepted all wrong attempts were made simultaneously with accepted one. If problem wasn't solved, all attempts will be shown at start or won't be shown at all depending on [HideUnsolved]

 > Timer
     _Provides time_
     Necessary attribute: [StartTime]
     Optional attribute: [StartDate]
     Doesn't really parses anything or affects standings directly. It's only purpose is to count time from contest start. By default StartDate equals to present date. StartTime should be in format "hh:mm". Format for StartDate is "yyyy/mm/dd"

To run the program first argument of program must be XML config. If none 
provided will be shown help message

Every parser may have additional parameter [Style] that highlights rows, 
provided by this parser in different colors:
  0 - (default value) transparent
  1 - yellow
  2 - orange
  3 - pink
  4 - silver

The example of configuration file:

 <Builder>
   <ProblemCount>11</ProblemCount>
   <RefreshRate>300</RefreshRate>
   <OutputFile>output.html</OutputFile>
   <Parsers>
     <Timer StartTime="00:00"/>
     <NEERCXmlParser Path="standings.xml" Style="1"/>
   </Parsers>
 </Builder>
