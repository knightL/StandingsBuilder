README for StandingsBuilder v1.1
===========

This is program for building standings for ACM contests from different sources 
like other standings or logs of contests. The result of work is HTML file with
merged standings

The program requires libxml2 and libcurl in order to work properly. In case you
use Ubuntu it is enough to use any of these command:

     sudo apt-get install libxml2-dev libcurl4-openssl-dev
     sudo apt-get install libxml2-dev libcurl4-gnutls-dev
     sudo apt-get install libxml2-dev libcurl4-nss-dev

Program requires XML config of the following form (case sensitive):

    <Builder>
      <ProblemCount>11</ProblemCount>
      <Timeout>300</Timeout>
      <OutputFile>output.html</OutputFile>
      <Parsers>
        ...List of parsers to use...
      </Parsers>
    </Builder>

ProblemCount is number of problems in current contest
Timeout is delay in seconds, after which output file will be rewritten
OutputFile is path to file, where the result of program will be written

Parsers should contain list of parsers (programs, that fetch information and
place it into log). Currently supported parsers:

 > EjudgeLinkParser
     Necessary attribute: [URL]
     Optional attribute: [Timeless]=No/Yes
     Downloads Ejudge standings from [URL], parses it and puts teams in it into 
     resulting standing. If [Timeless] is true, then there will be no attempts
     to wetch time of submissions
     Provides time.
 > EjudgeFileParser
     Necessary attribute: [Path]
     Optional attribute: [Timeless]=No/Yes
     Same as EjudgeLinkParser, but instead of downloading opens local file
     Provides time.
 > NEERCXmlParser
     Necessary attribute: [XMLPath]
     Parses NEERC contests history pack and unrolles by simulating attempts from
     it.
 > NEERCHtmlParser
     Necessary attribute: [Path]
     Optional attribute: [HideUnsolved]=No/Yes
     Reads final standings of NEERC contest in HTML format and attempts to
     simulate it. It is unknown, when were wrong attempts made, so for problems 
     that were accepted all wrong attempts were made simultaneously with 
     accepted one. If problem wasn't solved, all attempts will be shown at start
     or won't be shown at all depending on [HideUnsolved]

To run the program first argument of program must be XML config. If none 
provided will be shown help message

Every parser may have additional parameter [Style] that highlights rows, 
provided by this parser in different colors:
  0 - (default value) transparent
  1 - yellow
  2 - orange
  3 - pink
  4 - silver

The example of configuration file:

  <Builder>
    <ProblemCount>13</ProblemCount>
    <Timeout>300</Timeout>
    <OutputFile>/tmp/output.html</OutputFile>
    <Parsers>
      <EjudgeLinkParser URL="http://ejudge.crimea.edu/2014/simf1/standings114.html"/>
      <EjudgeLinkParser URL="http://olimp.vntu.edu.ua/standings-lviv.php" Style="1"/>
      <EjudgeLinkParser URL="http://acm.khnu.km.ua/result07.php" Style="2"/>
      <EjudgeLinkParser URL="http://olimp.vntu.edu.ua/standings-kyiv.php" Style="3"/>
      <EjudgeLinkParser URL="http://ejudge.inform.snu.edu.ua/ejudge/standings5.html" Style="4" Timeless="yes"/>
    </Parsers>
  </Builder>
